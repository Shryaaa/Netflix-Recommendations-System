## Netflix Recommendation System

This project is a Netflix-style recommendation system built using Flask, designed to provide personalized movie and TV show recommendations based on user preferences and viewing history.

### Project Overview

The Netflix Recommendation System leverages collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to suggest relevant movies or TV shows to users. It integrates a recommendation model with a Flask web application to offer real-time suggestions through a RESTful API.

### Features

- **Personalized Recommendations:** Provides movie and TV show recommendations based on user ratings and viewing history.
- **Flask API:** A RESTful API built with Flask to serve recommendations dynamically.
- **Simple and Intuitive Interface:** Allows users to easily interact with the recommendation system through simple API calls.

### How It Works

1. **Data Preparation:** 
   - The system uses sample data for movies and user ratings. This data includes movie titles, genres, user ratings, and movie IDs.

2. **Recommendation Algorithms:**
   - **Collaborative Filtering:** Suggests content based on the similarity of user preferences.
   - **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends items based on content features and user interests.

3. **Flask Application:**
   - **Endpoints:** Defines routes for interacting with the recommendation system.
   - **Recommendation Logic:** Processes user input and generates personalized recommendations.

### Setup and Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/netflix-recommendation-system.git
   cd netflix-recommendation-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the API:**
   - Endpoint: `/recommend`
   - Method: `GET`
   - Parameters: `user_id` (Integer)
   - Example Request: `http://localhost:5000/recommend?user_id=1`

### Technologies Used

- **Python:** Programming language.
- **Flask:** Web framework for creating the API.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn:** Machine learning algorithms for recommendations.

### Future Enhancements

- **Improved Recommendation Algorithms:** Incorporate more advanced algorithms for better recommendations.
- **User Interface:** Develop a front-end application to interact with the recommendation system.
- **Scalability:** Optimize for larger datasets and high traffic scenarios.
